OSH is an app that listens top you hum (hm hm hmm) and guesses the song from it.

This project needs more musical data to be processed in order to work accurately.
But other than that, this showcase how you can utilize multi-threading / multiple background tasks to perform concurrent operations like big data analysis.
Concurrent operations are used in the app's digital signal processing, running everything on the phone.
